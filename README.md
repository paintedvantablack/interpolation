# interpolation

Approximation of functions using the Lagrange polynomial

Input X and Y values and press "Add value". The point will be added to the list.
After adding all points you'll can build a graph using original points.
If yoy will press "Interpolate", program will show approximated values between the points. Now you can build a graph using original and approximated values.
You also can save original and approximated graph as images pressing "Save as image".
